      "name": "Vertical Transitions",
      "description": "The number of times two adjacent cells in the same column don't match (one is filled and the other is empty). Lower weights make the AI prioritize column fills with fewer gaps, encouraging cleaner stacking patterns that are easier to clear later.",
      "example": "In this example, the arrows show the vertical transitions. There are 15 column transitions in total."
    },
    "row_trans": {
      "name": "Horizontal Transitions",
      "description": "The number of times two adjacent cells in the same row don't match (one is filled and the other is empty). Lower weights make the AI prioritize rows with fewer gaps, while higher weights encourage it to create pillars of tetrominoes.",

    "pits": {
      "name": "Holes",
      "description": "The number of empty cells with at least one filled cell above them. In Tetris, you generally want to avoid holes, as they make it harder to clear lines.",
      "example": "In this example, all holes are marked with crosses. There are 25 holes in total."

    "landing_height": {
      "name": "Landing Height",
      "description": "The height at which the tetromino is placed. Higher values make the AI prioritize higher placements, while lower values favor lower placements.",

    },
    "eroded_cells": {
      "name": "Cleared Cells",
      "description": "The number of cells cleared from the tetromino itself as a result of the move. Higher values make the AI prioritize immediate line clears, which is safer but may prevent setting up larger combos like Tetrises (4-line clears).",
      "example": "In this example, the number of cleared cells is 4 because 4 cells are cleared from the tetromino due to the line being cleared when it is placed."

    "cuml_wells": {
      "name": "Wells",
      "description": "The total depth of all wells (empty columns surrounded by filled cells) on the board. Smaller wells can help in setting up Tetrises, but deeper wells are increasingly risky and harder to fill without causing a game over.",
      "example": "There are 4 wells in total in this example, with varying depths."
