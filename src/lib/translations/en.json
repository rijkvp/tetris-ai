    "text": "This tool lets you control an AI playing Tetris, a classic game. There are different levels with different goals that you can play so you can learn how the AI works. Sandbox mode lets you experiment with all the features. Have fun!\n\n<h2>How do I control the AI?</h2>\n\nAt the top of the Tetris board, there are buttons that allow you to play, pause, reset, or step through the game. You can also adjust the speed of the game and the weights of the features. On the left, you can see the stats of the current game played by the AI. It shows the score (the more lines cleared, the higher the score), the number of lines cleared, the current level (every 10 lines is a level), and the number of tetrises you have made (clearing 4 rows at once). The goals show the objectives you need to complete to finish the level.\n\n<h2>How does the AI work?</h2>\n\nThe AI calculates all possible positions and rotations where it can be placed for every tetromino it has to play. Then, it evaluates them using a set of features. The AI then chooses the move with the highest score. You can adjust the importance of different features using the sliders to meet the goals. The weights of these features determine how important they are in the evaluation. For example, if you think a feature is very important, you can increase its weight to make the AI prioritize it. Or, if you think a feature should be avoided, you can decrease its weight."
